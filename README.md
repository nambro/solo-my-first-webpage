## Description

Axy Academy is a Accessible Learning Environment (ALE), akin to popular Learning Management Systems. Axy Academy ALE is both a training resource for accessibility advocates, and a proof of concept for the next gen Learning Management System, dubbed (by me) the *Accessible Learning Environment*. This concept class is a glimpse into the future of eLearning;

ALE utilizes built in features that provide a universally designed, learner centric online class for students by giving instructors intuitive, content authoring and management tools to effortlessly produce and import accessible learning Materials.
