## Description

_{Axy Academy is a Accessible Learning Environment (ALE), akin to popular Learning Management Systems. Axy Academy ALE is both a training resource for accessibility advocates, and a proof of concept for the next gen Learning Management System, dubbed (by me) the 'Accessible Learning Environment'.
